# Monte Carlo simulation of VaR
This is the work done for my bachelor thesis in Mathematical Engineering .

In this jupyter notebook I create a simulation of a stock portfolio of stocks using real historical data. I used the Monte Carlo method for the simulation and the normal probability distribution, for didactical purpose, to describe the return of the stocks.
The code can be used for a bigger portfolio and different stocks just modifying the first part of the code.
